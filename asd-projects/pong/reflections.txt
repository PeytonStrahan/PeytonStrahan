User Story / Gameplay
    Describe the gameplay
        Two paddles are bouncing a ball back and forth.
    What are the conditions when the game begins?
        The game begins when one player moves their paddle.
            ~could make the game start when both players hold right or left or some other key~
    Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
        When one player gets to 11 points.
            ~could add a tiebreaker mechanic or just a tied winstate~
    What ifs will there be?
        If the ball crosses over the board edge, then the opposite player earns a point.

        If the ball hits a paddle, reverse the direction of the ball.
            ~position of impact could affect how the ball is bounced back~

        If the ball hits the bottom or top of the board, reverse its direction.

        If player hits up or down arrow key, move the paddle in that right direction

        If a player scores 11, end the game and show the winner's name.

        If the ball hits one of the paddles, increase ball speed.

        If the paddle hits top or bottom edge of the board, stop the paddle.

        If the ball hits board edge, return the ball to the middle of the board and reset speed to starting speed.







Visual Game Components:
    What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box.
        board with a center line

        two paddles

        ball
            ~may be able to add a mode that has multiple balls on screen at once~

    Which will be static? (the board)

        The line
        The board
            ~may decorate static and nonstatic onbjects with textures, pictures, or gifs~

    Which will be animated? (the box)

        The ball and the paddles

    What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were positionX, speedX, and points.

        PositionX, positiony, speed x, speed y.









Events / Logic
    What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)

    keydown
    keyup
    ball touching the paddle.

    How do those events affect the data of the program?

        moves the paddle

        One player will use up, down keys and the other will use w and s

    For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!

        $(document).on("keydown", handleKeyDown)
        handleKeyDown(event){
            (enent.which === key.up){
                move paddle up
                increase position y
                    maybe we will decrease the "top" css position
            }

            (event.which === key.down){
                move paddle down
                adjust position y
            }

            when the balle hits the paddle{
                change the direction of the ball
                increase speed of the ball.
                    ~might have the movement of the paddles and exact position of where the ball hits the paddle affect how the ball is bounced back~
            }
        }
